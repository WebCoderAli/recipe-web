# Recipe App Development Algorithm

## 1. Set Up Your Project

- Create a new folder for your project.
- Inside this folder, create three files:
  - **index.html** – for the structure of your web page.
  - **style.css** – for styling your page.
  - **index.js** – for adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## 2. Write the HTML

- In **index.html**, set up the basic structure:
  - Add a header with navigation links and a search bar.
  - Create a main section where recipe results will be displayed.
  - Add a popup window to show recipe details.
  - Include a footer for copyright information.

## 3. Style with CSS

- In **style.css**, write styles to make your app look good:
  - Style the header, navigation links, and search bar.
  - Design the recipe cards with images and text.
  - Style the popup window and overlay for showing recipe details.

## 4. Add Functionality with JavaScript

- In **index.js**, write JavaScript code to:
  - Handle the search button click and fetch recipes from an API.
  - Display recipe results in the main section.
  - Show recipe details in a popup when a button is clicked.
  - Close the popup when clicking the close button or overlay, or pressing the Escape key.
